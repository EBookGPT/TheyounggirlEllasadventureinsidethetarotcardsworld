# Chapter 4: The Magician: A Question of Power

As Ella continued her journey through the tarot cards world, she found herself face to face with a man of great power. He was the Magician, and his very presence crackled with energy.

"Welcome, young Ella," he said, his voice echoing through the room. "I am the Magician, and I hold the secrets of the universe in my grasp."

Ella couldn't help but feel intimidated by the Magician's power. She wondered if she was strong enough to face him, to learn what he had to teach.

But the Magician didn't seem interested in testing her strength. Instead, he gestured to a table in the center of the room, covered in strange symbols and objects.

"Power is not just about strength," he said, his eyes sparkling with a knowing look. "It is also about knowledge, and the ability to use that knowledge to shape the world around us."

Ella approached the table, feeling a sense of awe as she examined each object carefully. There were wands, cups, swords, and pentacles, each one representing a different element of the universe.

The Magician was watching her carefully, his eyes following her every move.

"You see, Ella," he said, his voice low and melodic. "To be truly powerful, one must understand the elements that make up the universe. Only then can we wield their power with any real skill."

Ella nodded, understanding dawning on her face. She realized that true power wasn't just about brute force, but about knowledge and understanding.

But as she reached for one of the objects on the table, she felt a jolt of electricity shoot through her body. The Magician was testing her after all, and she would need all her strength and courage to pass his challenge.

What would happen next? Could Ella face off against the powerful Magician and emerge victorious? Only time would tell, as her adventure in the tarot cards world continued.
# The Wizard of Oz Parable: The Magician

As Ella stood before the Magician, she couldn't help but feel a sense of awe. The Magician was like a god, his power radiating from every pore.

But just as in the Wizard of Oz, things are not always as they seem. The Magician was not just a powerful man, but a teacher, imparting important lessons to Ella on her journey.

The Magician was like the Wizard, in that he held the secrets of the universe in his grasp, just as the Wizard held the secrets of the Emerald City. But like the Wizard, the Magician was not interested in testing Ella's strength. Rather, he was interested in teaching her the true nature of power.

Just as the Wizard gave Dorothy and her companions a heart, a brain, and courage, the Magician gave Ella knowledge, understanding, and the ability to wield the power of the universe.

But just as Dorothy and her companions had to face trials and tribulations to earn the Wizard's gifts, Ella too had to face a challenge. The Magician tested her, showing her that true power was not just about strength, but about knowledge and understanding.

In the end, just as Dorothy and her companions emerged victorious, Ella proved herself worthy of the Magician's teachings. She had learned an important lesson, that true power does not come from brute force, but from understanding and knowledge.

And like Dorothy, who returned to Kansas with a new appreciation for the world around her, Ella returned to her own world with a newfound understanding of the true nature of power, and the ability to use that power wisely.
